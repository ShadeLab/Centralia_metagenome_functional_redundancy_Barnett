### Contents

Code is split up into two directories: [Sequence_processing](https://github.com/ShadeLab/Centralia_metagenome_functional_redundancy_Barnett/tree/main/Sequence_processing) and [Analysis](https://github.com/ShadeLab/Centralia_metagenome_functional_redundancy_Barnett/tree/main/Analysis).

#### Sequence processing
Code used for sequence processing including ... Scripts were run using SLURM on the MSU HPCC using slurm batch files with suffix .sb and are numbered by their order in the processing workflow. Outputs such as logs, warnings, or errors if any, are designated by the suffix .out and named in accordence with the library, run number, and slurm batch file. 

#### Analysis
Formal analysis can be found under ... All analysis was run with R and code was run in Rmarkdown. In the analysis directory you'll find the raw Rmarkdown files (.Rmd), a github friendly markdown rendering (.md) and the associated figure files from the rendering in separate sub-directories. The analysis was broken down into multiple chunks in separate Rmarkdown files:
